# Lessons Learned & Common Pitfalls

## Evaluation Points: The "+1 Skip" Trap
**Bug**: When the last round has no split (no layer variable), the verifier must use `evaluation_points_ring[outer_points_len..]` (NO +1 skip) to evaluate the folded witness. Intermediate rounds skip +1 because the layer variable selects top/bottom halves of the split. The last round has no split, so all inner variables must be included.

**Rule**: The prover computes claims using `evaluation_points[outer_points_len..]` from the CURRENT round's sumcheck. The verifier must use the same points. For intermediate rounds, `new_evaluation_points_inner = eval_points[outer_points_len+1..]` because one variable is consumed by the split. For the last round, use `eval_points[outer_points_len..]`.

## Decomposition Base Log Must Fit i16
**Bug**: decomposition_base_log=12 caused i16 overflow in witness decomposition.
**Fix**: Changed to decomposition_base_log=8 (values fit in i16 range ±128).

## Deref Pattern for Enum Variants
When refactoring a struct into an enum with shared fields, use the `Deref` pattern:
- Extract shared fields into `FooCommon` struct
- Implement `Deref<Target = FooCommon>` for the enum
- Variant-specific fields (like `decomposition_base_log`, `next`) require explicit `match`
- This avoids changing hundreds of `config.field` call sites

## The `temp *= (&a, &b)` Idiom
This is NOT temp *= a * b. It's `temp = a * b` using the MulAssign<(&A, &B)> impl. The pattern for inner products is:
```rust
let mut temp = RingElement::zero(Representation::IncompleteNTT);
let mut result = RingElement::zero(Representation::IncompleteNTT);
for (w, r) in data.iter().zip(points.iter()) {
    temp *= (w, r);   // temp = w * r
    result += &temp;   // result += w * r
}
```

## PreprocessedRow vs Raw Evaluation Points
- `evaluation_point_to_structured_row(&points)` → `StructuredRow` (tensor-factored form)
- `PreprocessedRow::from_structured_row(&structured_row)` → expanded MLE evaluation vector
- The `.preprocessed_row` field has `2^n` elements (the full MLE evaluated at the point)
- Use this for inner products with witness data

## Two Separate Protocols
The codebase has TWO protocol implementations:
1. **salsaa** (`src/salsaa/executor.rs`): The active one. Recursive rounds, VDF, enum configs.
2. **protocol** (`src/protocol/`): Older implementation. Has its own executor, prover, verifier, config.
Don't confuse them — they have different types and flows.

## const DEBUG: bool
Line 46 of executor.rs. Set to `true` for extensive assertions during development (costs performance). Set to `false` for production runs.

## VDF Sumcheck Structure
- VDF matrix M has structure: g on diagonal, a on sub-diagonal (both are 64-element vectors)
- Batched with challenge powers: (d' ⊗ h)^T · w = -y_0 + c^{2K} · y_t
- h = g + c·a (64 elements), d' = (1, c, c^2, ..., c^{2K-1})
- d'_sumcheck: `LinearSumcheck::new_with_prefixed_sufixed_data(2K, 1, 6)`
- h_sumcheck: `LinearSumcheck::new_with_prefixed_sufixed_data(64, total_vars - 6, 0)`
- Verifier evaluates MLE[d'](x) = ∏_i ((1-x_i) + x_i · c^{2^i}) via tensor structure

## Proof Size
Current p-26 config: ~507 KB total proof
- Intermediate rounds (0-3): includes decomposed_split_commitment + projection_commitment
- IntermediateUnstructured rounds (4-6): includes decomposed_split_commitment + projection_image_ct + projection_image_batched (no structured projection columns)
- Last round (7): dominated by folded_witness (~96 KB) + projection_image_ct + projection_image_batched

## Verifier Timing (p-26, 8 rounds)
- Intermediate rounds (0-3): ~275-400µs each
- IntermediateUnstructured rounds (4-6): ~50-68µs each
- Last round (7): ~273µs (commitment recomputation ~127µs)
- Total verify: ~1.9ms

## Test Expectations
- 77/78 tests pass (1 known failure: `test_index_out_of_bounds` in release mode)

## IntermediateUnstructured: Key Design Points
- `Prefix { prefix: 0, length: 0 }` means NO extended witness doubling; `paste_by_prefix` with length 0 requires src fills entire dest; `SelectorEq` with 0 prefix bits evaluates to constant 1
- First IntermediateUnstructured round has 8 columns (from Intermediate's 8-col decomposition output); subsequent ones have 4 columns (2 split × 2 decomp chunks)
- No structured projection (no Type3 sumcheck), but has unstructured projection via Type3.1 sumcheck
- `projection_ratio` field on both IntermediateUnstructured and Last variants, capped by `MAX_UNSTRUCT_PROJ_RATIO = 128`
- `build_round_config`'s else branch must return `Intermediate { next: IntermediateUnstructured(...) }`, NOT `IntermediateUnstructured` directly (which would skip the last Intermediate round)
- Verifier `load_data`: `main_cols_points` start index must use `config.main_witness_prefix.length`, not hardcoded 1

## Type3.1 (Unstructured Projection) Sumcheck
- Proves `<c_2 ⊗ c_0 ⊗ j_batched, witness> = batched_projection` for each of NOF_BATCHES (64) batches
- `j_batched` = random linear combination of projection rows (via `compute_j_batched`)
- `c_0` selects across blocks, `c_1` selects within blocks (for CT check), `c_2` selects across columns
- `BatchedProjectionChallengesSuccinct` stores layered form of challenges for efficient MLE evaluation
- Prover sends `projection_image_ct` (coefficient tuples) + `projection_image_batched` (NTT form)

## CT Consistency Check
The verifier checks that constant terms of `projection_image_batched` entries are consistent with `projection_image_ct`:
- For each batch `i` and column `k`: recompute expected constant term by inner product of `c_1_values ⊗ c_0_values` with `projection_image_ct` entries
- Compare against `projection_image_batched[(i,k)].constant_term_from_incomplete_ntt()`
- This ensures the prover didn't cheat on the NTT-domain batched projections

## Claim Batching Order
`batch_claims()` combines claims in a fixed order with Fiat-Shamir combination coefficients:
1. Type1 claims (inner_evaluation_claims × folded over outer evaluation points)
2. Type3 zero claim (Intermediate only — placeholder since Diff sumcheck has 0 target)
3. L2 product claim (if l2 enabled)
4. Linf product claim (if exact_binariness enabled)
5. VDF product claim (if vdf enabled)
6. Type3.1 claims (NOF_BATCHES claims for unstructured projection)
The verifier must reproduce this exact order.
