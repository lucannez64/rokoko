// Selector is a sumcheck that of eq(x, s) over all x in {0,1}^n

// we allow that nof_variables can be larger than the number of bits in selector. Selector specifies only the higher order bits.

// E.g. selector = 0b10, nof_variables = 4 means that
// f(x_0, ... x_3) = eq(x0 x1, 1 0)
// Alternatively, this SelectorEq is functionally equivalent to linear sumcheck over vector (0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0)
// However, this implementation is more efficient in space and time.
// as univariate_polynomial_at_point_into returns `false` unless the point matches the selector in the higher order bits.
// This is useful for implementing sumcheck over sparse vectors.
