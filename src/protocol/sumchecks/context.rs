///
/// This structure holds all the sumcheck gadgets needed to verify one internal layer
/// of a recursive commitment. Each layer proves that the commitment at this level is
/// correctly derived from the child layer's commitment via decomposition and composition.
///
/// **Recursive Commitment Background:**
/// A recursive commitment is a tree structure where:
///   - Leaves: commitments to chunks of the original witness
///   - Internal nodes: commitments to the concatenation of their children's commitments
///   - Root: the final public commitment
///
/// Each internal layer needs to prove: "The data at my prefix, when committed with CK,
/// equals the composed version of my child's commitment."
///
/// **Field-by-Field Explanation:**
///
/// - `selector_sumcheck`: Picks out this layer's data slice from the combined witness.
///   This ensures we're only looking at the portion of the witness that belongs to this
///   layer, ignoring all other prefixes.
///
/// - `child_selector_sumcheck`: Picks out the child layer's data slice. This is Some(...)
///   for all non-leaf layers (because there's a child to check against) and None for the
///   leaf layer (which has no child and serves as the base case).
///
/// - `combiner_sumcheck`: Linear sumcheck holding the radix weights for recomposing the
///   child's decomposed value. For example, if we decompose base 2^8 into 4 chunks, this
///   holds [1, 2^8, 2^16, 2^24]. Multiplying the decomposed chunks by these weights and
///   summing gives us the original value. This is Some(...) for non-leaf layers and None
///   for leaf layers (which don't need recomposition).
///
/// - `combiner_constant_sumcheck`: Holds the constant offset that needs to be subtracted
///   after recomposition. This arises from signed-digit representation: to keep decomposed
///   chunks small, we allow negative digits, which introduces a known constant bias that
///   must be corrected. This is Some(...) for non-leaf layers and None for leaf layers.
///
/// - `data_selected_sumcheck`: A product sumcheck that combines the selector with the
///   combined witness to produce "this layer's data, selected and ready to use." This is
///   a helper gadget that gets reused across all CK row checks, so we compute it once and
///   share references.
///
/// - `rhs_sumcheck`: The "right-hand side" of the constraint, representing the composed
///   child commitment. For non-leaf layers, this is a DiffSumcheck that computes:
///     child_selector · (recomposed_child_commitment)
///   For leaf layers, this could be a LinearSumcheck directly if we're checking against
///   a public value. The type is boxed as `dyn HighOrderSumcheckData` to allow for this
///   flexibility.
///
/// - `commitment_sumcheck`: Optional linear sumcheck for the public commitment value at
///   this layer. This is Some(...) for leaf layers (where we check against the public
///   commitment) and None for non-leaf layers (where we check against the child's
///   recomposed commitment instead).
///
/// - `ck_sumchecks`: A vector of linear sumchecks, one per rank. Each holds one row of
///   the commitment key (CK) for this layer. The rank determines how many constraints
///   we're batching together—higher rank means more CK rows, which gives stronger binding
///   but increases proof size.
///
/// - `outputs`: A vector of DiffSumchecks, one per CK row. Each output proves:
///     CK_row_i · selected_data = composed_child_commitment
///   These are the constraints that the verifier will check. All outputs share references
///   to the same underlying selectors, data, and child commitment, so we're efficiently
///   reusing computation across rows.
///
/// **Why So Many Fields?**
/// The complexity arises from the need to handle both non-leaf and leaf layers uniformly
/// while allowing for different constraint types (difference vs. product sumchecks), and
/// from the sharing of sub-computations across multiple CK rows to minimize prover work.
